## Development folder

This folder is the brave unknown of our codebase. Programs in it might work, or they might not get 
past init. It will range from having fully functional pieces of art to half baked ideas that barely 
have enough content to compile. Do whatever you want in here, the only thing I ask is that you keep
it error free, so that we can still run code. I think there will need to be some organization in 
here, but I don't know what I want it to look like so I am not going to bother for now.
